termnotify - notifications daemon

Tells dbus to send it notifications, currently prints them to terminal. Code largely pulled from https://github.com/halhen/statnot/blob/master/statnot

Seems to work when manual dbus messages are sent; either I've done something wrong or Firefox on FreeBSD isn't built with dbus.
